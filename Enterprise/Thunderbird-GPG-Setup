   The HCA help desk or Email department will likely know all the answers. =
Hopefully that will be quick and easy.

If you want to try and discover them yourself, here are some notes. I=E2=80=
=99ve added additional comments in green.

The Thunderbird needs to know the mail server(s) to receive and send messag=
es through. The Thunderbird program is only needed when opening or sending =
a PGP encrypted message. (Outlook can do it, but the add-ons cost money)

I recommend changing the name of the Thunderbird icon on the desktop to =E2=
=80=9CSecure Email=E2=80=9D to remind the user of what it is for, and say t=
hat they should use Outlook for everything else.=20

Follow the instructions below to set up Thunderbird to receive your exchang=
e? <http://oregonstate.edu/helpdocs/glossary/exchange>  email.

1.      Open Thunderbird=20

o    Note: If this is the first time opening Thunderbird, it will automatic=
ally ask you to add a new account. If this is the case, you can skip to ste=
p D

2.      Go to Tools and click on account settings

3.      Under Account Actions in the bottom left, select 'Add Mail Account'

4.      Fill in the Name field (This part is just a matter of personal pref=
erence)

5.      Enter in your first.last@HCAhealthcare.com into the Email field and=
 type in your password below.

6.      Click on the 'Continue' Button in the bottom right, then when it ap=
pears click on the 'Manual Config' Button in the bottom left. The window wi=
ll expand and create more options you can fill in

7.      On the Incoming row:=20

o    Select IMAP from the dropdown menu

o    Type gw.nas.medcity.net in the server hostname box (MM - This setting =
can be tested, see notes are below)

o    Select 993 from the Port dropdown menu

o    Select SSL/TLS from the SSL dropdown menu

o    Select Normal Password from the Authentication dropdown menu

8.      On the Outgoing row:=20

o    Type smtp-gw.nas.medcity.net in the server hostname box

o    Select 587 from the Port dropdown menu (MM - This setting can be teste=
d, see notes below)

o    Select STARTTLS from the SSL dropdown menu

o    Select Normal Password from the Authentication dropdown menu

9.      Enter your domain (either MedCity.net or MEDCITY), followed by a ba=
ckslash ("\"), followed by your username (blv6864) in the Username box=20

o    Note: If you don't know your domain, username, or password, you can co=
ntact your Department Computer Administrator for help.

10.  Once finished, all the settings should look like this (click on image =
for larger version):

 <http://oregonstate.edu/helpdocs/sites/default/files/email/exchange/client=
s/thunderbird/tbird1.png> Description: Thunderbird Exchange

11.  Click the Advanced Config Button. This will open up the Thunderbird se=
ttings window shown below.

12.  Once open, click on the Outgoing Server option in the left-hand menu

13.  Make sure the outgoing server you just created (will be called mail.or=
egonstate.edu) is set to default and selected

14.  Click the Edit button (you can click on the image below for a larger v=
ersion) <http://oregonstate.edu/helpdocs/sites/default/files/email/exchange=
/clients/thunderbird/tbird2.png> Description: Thunderbird Main Settings

15.  Remove the domain and backslash from the username box (either MEDCITY\=
, or MedCity.net\) <http://oregonstate.edu/helpdocs/sites/default/files/ema=
il/exchange/clients/thunderbird/tbird3.png> Description: Domain Removal

16.  Click OK when you are finished, then OK again to close the main settin=
gs window

o    Note: This may seem counter-intuitive, adding the domain, then removin=
g it again. For some reason, Thunderbird will not send mail without removin=
g the domain, but if the domain is not present at the beginning, Thunderbir=
d will not retrieve mail. It should be able to receive and send mail just f=
ine if you follow the above instructions exactly.

Thunderbird should then begin downloading your mail!

It may take a while to download all your mail if you have a large mailbox, =
or a slower network connection. If your mail doesn't appear at first, give =
it time to catch up. After a few minutes your mailbox should load.

To test the server names,

Method 1)

Start, Programs, Accessories, Command Prompt

In the black rectangular box that opens, type:

NSLOOKUP

=20

At the > prompt, type:

gw.nas.medcity.net

smtp-gw.nas.medcity.net

imap-gw.nas.medcity.net

exchange.medcity.net

=20

If the name entered is a real server name, you will see the name followed b=
y its IP address. If the name isn=E2=80=99t a valid server, you will see =
=E2=80=9Ccan't find gw.nas.medcity.net: Non-existent domain=E2=80=9D

=20

To find the name of your exchange server, type these commands in the Comman=
d Prompt =E2=80=93 nslookup:

set type=3Dall

_autodiscover._tcp.hcahealthcare.com

_autodiscover._tcp.medcity.net

=20

Type:

exit

to exit nslookup

=20

Method 2)

If you have Windows XP, this is easy, (if you have Windows 7, you would pro=
bably have to first go to Control Panel, Programs and Features, Turn Window=
s features on or off, check the box beside Telnet Client, click OK)

In the Command prompt, type:

telnet

=20

At the > prompt, type:

open smtp-gw.nas.medcity.net 25

=20

If it is not the correct server name and port number, you will see =E2=80=
=9CCould not open connection to the host, on port 25:=E2=80=9D

If it is correct, you will see =E2=80=9C220 smtp-gw.nas.medcity.net Microso=
ft ESMTP MAIL Service,=E2=80=9D

If you connect successfully, type the following to exit:

quit

=20

If you don=E2=80=99t connect, try another combination:

open gw-nas.medcity.net 25

=20

try various names. After identifying the SMTP server, you can test for the =
IMAP by changing the 25 to the number 143

open imap-gw.nas.medcity 143

open exchange.medcity.net 143

=20

If it is correct, you will see =E2=80=9C+OK Microsoft Exchange IMAP4rev1 se=
rver=E2=80=9D

If you connect successfully, press the following two keys to exit:

Ctrl+[

=20

Type:

quit
